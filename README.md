# rev
rev is a Python command line utility that aims to provide more string reversing functionality than the one that already exists.

Planned usage:
rev # Read strings line by line from standard input and reverse them

rev -w # Read strings line by line from standard input and reverse the word order

rev -w -c # Read strings line by line from standard input and reverse the word order and reverse the characters in each word

rev file.txt # Output the contents of the file with each line reversed

rev file.txt --ignore-newlines # Reverse everything in the string, ignoring newlines
